Topic C, Job Offers: the system is a catalogue of job offers and job applicants. Employers can create job offers and search the applicants’ database. Job applicants can advertise themselves; search the job offers’ database. Basic forms of automatic matching can be investigated. Administrators can create, modify and delete all entries. Please refer to www.monster.com.sg, www.dice.com or other job offer sites for examples and data. 14 In order to meet the minimum requirements, the system should allow 1) browsing and searching of entries (basic and advanced search features) and ancillary data, and 2) creation, deletion, and modification of entries and ancillary data. Simple login and sessions may be required by the topic but advanced access control or shopping basket is not required. Extra credit will be gained by appropriate usage and demonstration of advanced SQL and DBMS features (advanced SQL queries such as aggregates, nested queries, views, non standard integrity constraints, triggers, and stored procedures).
